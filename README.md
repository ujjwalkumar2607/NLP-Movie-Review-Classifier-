# NLP-Movie-Review-Classifier-
Sentiment analysis in texts using tokenizations and word embeddings trained using imdb_reviews datasets.

The vecs.tsv file and meta.tsv file can be used to visualise the word embeddings. 
We can use the Embedding Projector by tensorflow which is available at https://projector.tensorflow.org/ and "Load" the vecs.tsv file under "Vectors" and meta.tsv file under "Metadata".
